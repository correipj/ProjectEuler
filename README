An archive of the various [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems I have solved

To anyone who has stumbled upon this repo while searching for the solutions to
a Project Euler problem: I really recommend you don't spoil the solution for
yourself and instead think about the problem just a little longer. I haven't 
included any of the actual solutions here, only the source-code. The fun and 
satisfcation of Project Euler lies in solving the problem for yourself, not in
entering a number into a web form. You might get credit for the answer but it
won't feel as good as solving it for yourself.

Some of the problems are better documented than others.

Good luck to all who enter.
