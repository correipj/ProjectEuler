-Smarter isPrime function, from project-euler forums:
For 32 bits integers you don't have to carry out the complete Miller-Rabin to
establish primality, it suffices to call the witness function max. 3 times with
bases resp. 2, 7 and 61. this leads to a very fast primality test for numbers 
up to about 4.3 billion (I forgot the first failure, but it's over 2^32).

Implement next_combination function?
